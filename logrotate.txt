logrotate - rotates, compresses, and mails system logs

Synopsis:
    logrotate [-dv] [-f|--force] [-s|--state file] config_file+

Description:
  logrotate  is  designed to ease administration of systems that generate
  large numbers of log files.  It allows automatic rotation, compression,
  removal, and mailing of log files.  Each log file may be handled daily,
  weekly, monthly, or when it grows too large.

  Normally, logrotate is run as a daily cron job.  It will not  modify  a
  log  multiple  times  in  one  day unless the criterium for that log is
  based on the log's size and logrotate is being run multiple times  each
  day, or unless the -f or -force option is used.

  Any number of config files may be given on the command line. Later con-
  fig files may override the options given in earlier files, so the order
  in  which  the logrotate config files are listed in is important.  Nor-
  mally, a single config file which includes any other config files which
  are  needed  should  be used.  See below for more information on how to
  use the include directive to accomplish this.  If a directory is  given
  on  the  command line, every file in that directory is used as a config
  file.

  If no command line arguments are given, logrotate  will  print  version
  and  copyright  information,  along with a short usage summary.  If any
  errors occur while rotating logs, logrotate  will  exit  with  non-zero
  status.
